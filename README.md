# ðŸ”¥ Multi-Disease Predictor

This is my first **Machine Learning** project: a **Multi-Disease Predictor** that can diagnose three critical diseasesâ€”Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinsonâ€™s Diseaseâ€”using various machine learning models.

---

## ðŸš€ Technologies & Models Used
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier.
- **Libraries**: Utilized Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, and other essential libraries.
- **Web Application**: Developed an interactive UI using **Streamlit** for easy accessibility and usability.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Multi-Disease Diagnosis**: Predicts the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease based on user input.
- **Model Performance**: Achieves over **80% accuracy** for each disease through model selection and optimization.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive interface built with **Streamlit**.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes feature selection, scaling, and handling missing values for robust predictions.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements
Looking forward to improving and extending this project! Some ideas include:
- **Enhancing Model Performance**: Fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring deep learning models.
- **Expanding Disease Coverage**: Adding more diseases to the predictor.
- **Integrating with APIs**: Connecting with healthcare databases for real-time diagnosis.
- **Improving UI/UX**: Making the web application more visually appealing and user-friendly.
